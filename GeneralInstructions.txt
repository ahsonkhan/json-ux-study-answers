Please start with Scenario 1 and work your way through to Scenario 5.

You are allowed to look at any of the cs, csproj, and json files within the repository.

Unless otherwise stated, do NOT modify the input.json files or any input JSON strings.
You should not need to modify any of the project files (i.e. csproj).

Boiler plate code is provided as a starting point to avoid using unrelated APIs so try to leverage what's already there and focus on the task at hand.
Each scenario has a TODO comment with instructions along with some notes.
